Basis: Spring MVC
and Spring Boot
Model view: Thymeleaf
DB connection: Postgres

Do I really need both MVC and BOOT?
How should I start app if I have Tomcat server AND application properties?
Now I've just decided to split in two controllers: one is MVC the other is Boot

TODO: set redirect if no unit with such ID
